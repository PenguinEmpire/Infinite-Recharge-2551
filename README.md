FRC Team 2551 Penguin Empire Robotics' code for the 2020 season, Infinite Recharge.

## Software features

Hopefully lots. :smile:

## Useful links - reference, tips, resources, etc.

### General FRC stuff

- **docs.wpilib.org**. This is a very useful website.
- Also useful are the WPILibC (they call it that, but it's the C++ version) API docs, at https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/cpp/index.html.
- More coming soon, probably.

### Phoenix/CTRE/Talons

- The software for your computer can be downloaded at http://www.ctr-electronics.com/control-system/hro.html#product_tabs_technical_resources. You want the 'CTRE Phoenix Framework Installer'. Not sure if this will install on Mac.
- Software documentation for CTRE stuff is at https://phoenix-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
- API docs for C++ version of `CTRE_Phoenix` are at http://www.ctr-electronics.com/downloads/api/cpp/html/index.html. **Note that this is not yet up-to-date with the 2020 version of the library** (as of late on 2020-01-04), per https://phoenix-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blog/blog-kickoff-2020.html#online-api-documentation.
- Examples of the API in use can be found at https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-Examples-Languages/tree/master/C%2B%2B

### Other stuff

Coming soon, probably.
